## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability in the Kasware Project codebase, we urge you to report it promptly to ensure the security of our community. Here's how you can report:

- **Exploitable Vulnerabilities**: If you believe the vulnerability is exploitable by any users, please join our Discord server at [Kasware Discord](https://sapphirejs.dev/discord) and notify anyone with the "Developers" or "Collaborators" role.

- **Non-Exploitable Vulnerabilities**: If the vulnerability is not exploitable by users, you have two options:
  - Use the GitHub issue tracker to report the issue.
  - Join our Discord server through [Kasware Discord](https://sapphirejs.dev/discord) and share the details in the `#coding-den` channel.
